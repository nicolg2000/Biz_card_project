# BizCardX

## Project Description
BizCardX is a tool designed to extract business card data using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. It provides a streamlined Graphical User Interface (GUI) powered by Streamlit, enabling users to easily upload images of business cards and extract relevant information. The extracted data is stored in a SQL database for further analysis and usage.

## Technologies Used
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Used to recognize text from images of business cards.
- Streamlit GUI: Provides an intuitive web-based interface for users to interact with the application.
- SQL (Structured Query Language): Used for storing and managing the extracted business card data.
- Data Extraction: Techniques utilized to parse and extract relevant information from the OCR output.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of business cards through the GUI.
- **Text Extraction**: Utilizes OCR to extract text from the uploaded images.
- **Data Storage**: Extracted data is stored in a SQL database for easy access and retrieval.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific business card entries within the stored data.
- **Export Options**: Provides options to export extracted data in various formats for external use.


## Usage
1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Upload an image of a business card using the provided interface.
3. Wait for the OCR process to extract text from the image.
4. View the extracted data on the GUI or perform searches within the stored data.
5. Export the data if needed using the provided options.
